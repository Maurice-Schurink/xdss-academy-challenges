# XDSS Academy challenges
This repository is for training future data-scientists in "industry-like" environment. 

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository. 
2. Read about each challenge and download the data.
3. Write code to solve the problem.
4. Export the notebook to python script and push the notebooks and python script to GitHub.
5. When having good results, create a pull request.
6. I will comment on the changes.
7. We reiterate with the comments until we're good to move forward to the next challenge. 

## Notes
* The idea is to write good code which theoretically could be used for future deployments. 
* This project is about training, not just results.  
* Use Python, in a virtual environment, conda or pipenv, and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).
* Always start by splitting the data into three parts: *train*, *validations* and *test*. You can use the *test* dataset **only once!** to prevent overfitting.
* The example code already have issues in it - good luck!
* Work with branches, not on the master in Github. 
* Try to commit every atomic change to GitHub, instead of big uploads of a lot of code.
